# halloween-chuckles

Code repository for my silly Halloween Display - Chuckles the Clown.  Currently runs on an RPi 2/3 with IOT Edge installed and managed by an Azure IOT Hub.  

Code runs as one container with one main python script and various other scripts which control and operate the various sequences - mostly relay switches via GPIO.

Currently uses Flask in the main pythn script for manual control.
